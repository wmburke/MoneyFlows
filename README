This is a personal project to track finances. It conceives of money as something that comes and goes in flows. The places it rests are harbors - these may be checking accounts, credit cards, or your best friend - all places where money goes for a while, but never stays forever.

<h1>Core Principles</h1>
<ol>
	<li>I manage my finances and don't just trust what my bank says.</li>
	<li>My data is mine and I don't want to give it out in exchange for being marketed to.</li>
	<li>I should still be able to access my info anywhere I go.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Current Status</h1>
It is usable to track your bills and reconcile against what your bank says. This means you can:
<ul>
	<li>Enter flows: bills paid, money received, and money transfered between harbors that are yours. You can provide as much detail or as little as you want.</li>
	<li>Mark these flows as verified accurate (if it was an estimate when you originally entered it), sent, or paid.</li> 
	<li>Enter additional info about the harbors: full name, account number, contact info, notes.</li>
	<li>All data is saved in local storage within your browser on your computer.</li>
	<li>You can optionally sync it to a CouchDB database online.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
There's lots on the agenda, here is the rough order:
<ul>
	<li>Recurring flows</li>
	<li>Ability to sort and search flows</li>
	<li>Reminders of upcoming bills</li>
	<li>Better security</li>
</ul>

<h1>Additional Info</h1>
It's all built in javascript so far with PouchDB providing the database backend functionality. It's actually pretty cool.
